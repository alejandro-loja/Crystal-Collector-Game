In this assignment I am familarizing myself with jQuery. I create my own CSS style and added some subtle animation.

##Rules: Crystal Collector Game
  You will get a random number at the beginning of the game.

  By clicking on a crystal you will add to your score.

  You win the game by matching your total score to the generated number.

  The value of each crystal is unknown until you click on the crystals.
