This is a project I did trying out jQuery. I used css, including adding a subtle color animation.

## Rules: Crystal Collector Game
- You will get a random number at the beginning of the game.
- By clicking on a crystal you will add to your score.
- You win the game by matching your total score to the generated number.
- The value of each crystal is unknown until you click on the crystals.
